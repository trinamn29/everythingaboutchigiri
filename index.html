    <h2>Chigiri's Past</h2>
    <p>Before joining Blue Lock, Chigiri was a rising star in his high school soccer team. However, a serious knee injury caused him to step away from the sport out of fear of permanent damage. His passion for soccer never faded, but his inner conflict held him back for a long time.</p>
    <p>He was known as a prodigy from a young age, often compared to top athletes, and was scouted by many schools. But his injury made him cautious, and for a while, he played conservatively, refusing to sprint or risk reinjury. This period of hesitation deeply impacted his confidence and identity as a striker.</p>
